Numerical Approximations of N-body Problems.<br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b><br>

The N-body problem is a system of N second-order differential equations that cannot be expressed as a closed-form solution to date. This project weighs the options of using various numerical approximation methods to solve these problems, which are valuable in modelling the early structuring of our universe and the formation of star clusters in astrodynamics. A comparison of methods is made on the basis of accuracy, (computational) efficiency, and stability, which are usually the three quantities of interest in numerical approximation. Preliminary findings from the problem investigation show that even a simple method like symplectic Euler can provide satisfactory simulation results for some elementary N-body problems with acceptable trade-offs in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
